## Draft email response based on Scenario E

Dear Jake,

Thank you for reaching out.

As part of the application process, one of our requirements for Android applicants is to [complete the pre-work project](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/prework)

Here are some helpful tips to follow: 

1. Complete the [pre-work project](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/prework)
2. Once you have completed the ToDo application, pushed your code to GitHub with the README and GIF walkthrough included, you'll submit the project
3. Once you have completed all required user stories and added a README as described above then you are ready to notify us that you are ready for a pre-work review. Visit your application dashboard and submit using the pre-work form.

Make sure to review the [pre-work project](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/android_university/prework) thoroughly before submitting.

The course begins when you've completed the pre-work project, we will schedule a short phone call with you so we can chat further and answer any questions you have about the boot camp and the rest of the selection process.

Please let me know if you have any questions. We will be glad to assist you.

Thank you!

All the best,

**Gerald**
