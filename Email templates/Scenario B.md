Thank you for your interest. We have really appreciated the effort and time that you put into the qualification process. Currently, this particular course is respectively intended for students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States.

But know that we do have ambitions well beyond that and we already run programs in other countries such as Haiti. We are planning to expand to many more areas as well.

While this course is not available for you, we would encourage you to sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst), we’ll notify you as classes become available in your area powered by local organizers or through remote means.

In the meantime, there are a lot of resources out there for people interested in learning Android, and we’ve done some work to make them more accessible. We have [many online resources for learning Android](https://support.codepath.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-can-i-get-started-learning-android-development-online) including an extensive [list of Android resources online.](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Beginning-Android-Resources#beginning-android-resources)
