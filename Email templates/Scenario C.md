# Scenario C: Applicant who missed the deadline
## Draft email response based on Scenario C

Hi Anne,

I hope you are doing well. We highly appreciate your interest in our **Interview Prep course.** However, we noticed that you have missed the deadline before the closing date which was **2 weeks ago.** Because of this, we could not get you registered as our admissions are now closed and the class is full. 

As you know, we run this course every summer so we encourage you to apply again in the next run.

Meanwhile, for tips and guidelines, you might find this [high-level software interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view) helpful.

We are looking forward to your application next summer.

Please let me know if you have any questions. We will be glad to assist you.

Thank you!

All the best,

**Gerald**
